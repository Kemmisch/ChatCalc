Adds the ability to tab-complete an equation in the chat bar like so:

`3+3 -> **TAB** -> 6`

`4\*4= -> **TAB** -> 4\*4=16`

This can be very useful in building or crafting, as you will never need to risk mental math or need to pull out a calculator. In mods or servers like Hypixel SkyBlock, in which crafting recipes can be very expensive, this mod is a great utility.

 
Pressing tab with the cursor on the following equations will yield these results:

`3+3 -> **TAB** -> 6`

`4*4 -> **TAB** -> 16`

`4^2 -> **TAB** -> 16`

`sqrt(16) -> **TAB** -> 4`

`4*(4+3*3) -> **TAB** -> 52`

You may also put an equals sign (=) after the equation to keep it in the chat and include the solution after:

`8*2= -> **TAB** -> 8*2=16`

`26+cos(0)= -> **TAB** -> 26+cos(0)=27`


This calculator supports the following functions:

Addition (+)
Subtraction (-)
Multiplication (*)
Division (/)
 

Exponents (^ or \*\*)
Square root (sqrt(#))
Basic Trigonometry (sin(), cos(), tan())
 

3.1415926... (pi)

 

By default, solutions will be shown with comma separators (1,000) and up to 2 decimal places. This can be changed in the config file located in `.minecraft/config/chatcalc.conf`
